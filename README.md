# A Project Called Ø (Oslash)

Ø is an attempt to re-implement the code from 
[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) in
Python 3. The project contains:

 - Functors
 - Applicatives
 - Monoids
 - Maybe

Yes, I know there are other projects, but I'm simply doing this in order to
understand the book.
