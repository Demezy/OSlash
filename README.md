# A Project Called Ø (Oslash)

Ø is an attempt to re-implement the code from 
[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) in
Python 3. The project currently contains implementations for:

 - Functors
 - Applicatives
 - Monoids
 - Maybe

Yes, I know there are other projects, but I'm simply doing this in order to
better understand the book.

Why is the project called Ø? Just want to check if it's possible to have a 
projects name that uses unicode characters.
