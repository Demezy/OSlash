# A Project Called Ø (Oslash)

Ø is an attempt to re-implement some of the code from 
[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) in
Python 3. The project currently contains implementations for:

## Abstract Base Classes

 - Functor
 - Applicative
 - Monoid
 - Monad

## Monads
 
 - Maybe (Just | Nothing)
 - Either (Right | Left)
 - List

Yes, I know there are other projects out there, but I'm simply doing this in 
order to better understand the book.

Why is the project called Ø? Just want to check if it's possible to have a 
projects name that uses unicode characters.
